# Instagram bot follower that automatically logins in to Instagram and searches for account whose followers you want to follow and scrolls down 10 times to load up around 70 people to follow and then clicks the follow button with a gap in between to make sure Instagram's anti-bot feature does not detect anything suspicious. A use case for this project is that if you have an Instagram account with a similar topic to a popular Instagram account, in order to gain more followers following followers of the other channel might lead those followers to following you.
